		<h2>Reflections on CIS 241</h2>
		<p>
		As I get more used to being back in college after the pandemic, I have to say I am glad I have taken this class. College in general has been less
		stressful than it was a couple years ago, not to say everything has gone perfectly or that I don't need to improve somethings like time managaement. 
		Despite some rocky moments, especially the weekend where I fell a bit behind on my work since my neighborhood's internet was out for days, that didn't
		detract from the learning experience. It feels great learning a subject like web development more in depth especially since it's building upon previous
		classes I've taken like the visual basic development class I was in a year ago. It was also nice to learn CSS since it was like learning a new skill
		compared to HTML which I've worked with a little bit before or has some similarities to visual basic with the tags, and even though we only briefly 
		touched upon JavaScript in this class I think what we did learn about it will help me prepare for future classes or jobs. Even if I didn't always 
		know what to sometimes help was always available through Canvas messages and it felt great once everything clicked and I had a good idea on how to design
		this very website. I look forward to further building my skills whether they be future classes here at Edmonds College or somewhere else.
